   <p>We planned to start a venture .

While we were helping venture-backed startups with their go-to-market strategy, we started to notice something curious: Customers had gotten really good at buying stuff online. The tried and true tactics of old methods simply weren’t effective anymore.

Meanwhile, we started seeing massive growth in traffic in the main ecommerce sites. We’ll admit, we were surprised. It felt like a modern-day David versus Goliath.

So after many meetings, even more coffee we came to the simple observation:

People are fasting adopting ecommerce websites.

It was time to make our own venture. Time to treat buyers like people, not numbers on a spreadsheet. Time to build an inbound community and help people achieve their needs in an more efficient way.

We called it, The Mobile Store. </p>
